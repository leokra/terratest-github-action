# Terraform module terratest action

This action allows you to run terratest against a terraform module.


## Requirements

This action expects the terraform module to use terratest and for the tests to be under the test directory in the root of the repository.


## Usage

The common workflow is running terratest to test terraform against AWS. The action accepts input paramters:

  * **SSH_PRIV_KEY** - SSH private key with clone access to any further private repositories that may be needed

For authentication with AWS you can set the environment variables:

  * **AWS_ACCEDD_KEY_ID**
  * **AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY**

This action typically creates and destroys actual infrastructure and should only be run against dedicated test / sandbox accounts.
